Completing the Distance Converter Application

In the English measurement system, 1 yard equals 3 feet and 1 foot equals 12 inches. Use this information to create an application that lets the user convert distances to and from inches, feet, and yards.

Step 1 (1pt): Start Visual Studio and begin a new Windows Forms App project named DistanceConverter.

Step 2 (12pts): Set up the application’s form and reasonable properties as shown below:

The figure below shows an example of how the application’s form might appear. In the example, the user enters the distance to be converted into a TextBox. A ListBox allows the user to select the units being converted from, and another ListBox allows the user to select the units being converted to. 

Step 3 (6pts): Once you have the form and its controls and properties set up, you can create the Click event handlers for the two Button controls and test the application. In the Designer, double-click the two button controls, and write proper statements in the two event handlers. 

Note: Be sure to handle the situation where the user picks the same units from both list boxes. The converted value will be the same as the value entered.

Step 4 (1pt): Compress your project folder and submit. You must upload a .zip file which includes all the documents for this lab assignment to Canvas.
