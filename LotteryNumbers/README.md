In this Lab, you will complete an application that randomly generates lottery numbers. When the Generate Numbers button is clicked, the application will generate five two-digit integer numbers and store them in an array. The contents of the array will then be displayed in Label controls.

 

Step 1 (2 pts): Start Visual Studio and begin a new Windows Forms App Project named LotteryNumbers.

Step 2 (6 pts): Set up the application's form as shown in the Figure below. Notice that the form’s Text property is set to Lottery Numbers. The form has five Label controls and two Button controls. The names of the controls are shown in red text color. The value of BorderStyle property of the label controls should be Fixed3D.

Step 3 (8 pts): Once you have the form and its controls set up, you can create the Click event handlers for the Button controls. Double-click the generateButton control. This will open the code editor, and you will see an empty event handler named generateButton_Click. Complete the generateButton_Click event handler by typing the proper code to randomly generate five two-digit integer numbers and store them in an array, the contents of the array will then be displayed in five Label controls.

Switch your view back to the Designer and double-click the exitButton control. In the code editor you will see an empty event handler named exitButton_Click. Complete the exitButton_Click event handler by typing the proper code to close the application.
