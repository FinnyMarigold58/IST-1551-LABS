    Completing the Loan Qualifier Application

Complete an application that determines whether a person qualifies for a loan. To qualify for the loan, the person must earn a salary of at least $40,000 and must have been employed at his or her current job for at least 2 years.


Step 1 (1pt): Start Visual Studio and begin a new Windows Forms App project named LoanQualifier.

Step 2 (6pts): Set up the application’s form as shown in Figure below.

Step 3 (6pts): Once you have the form and its controls and properties set up, you can create the Click event handlers for the Button controls. In the Designer, double-click the three button controls, and write proper statements in the three event handlers. 

Step 4 (6pts): Save the project and use some examples to test the application.

First, enter 45,000 for the salary and 1 for the years at current job. Click the Check Qualifications button, and the application should display the message “Minimum years at current job not met.”

Click the Clear button. Enter 35,000 for the salary and 5 for the years at current job. Click the Check Qualifications button, and the application should display the message “Minimum salary requirement not met.”

Click the Clear button. Enter 45,000 for the salary and 5 for the years at current job. Click the Check Qualifications button, and the application should display the message “You qualify for the loan.”

Continue to test the application as you wish. When you are finished, click the Exit button, and the form should close.

Step 5 (1pt): Compress your project folder and submit. You must upload a .zip file which includes all the documents for this lab assignment to Canvas.
